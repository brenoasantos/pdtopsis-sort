## Project Description
This project implements the PDTOPSIS-Sort algorithm, which is a Preference Disaggregation Technique for Order Preferences by Similarity to Ideal Solution (PDTOPSIS). It is designed to support Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM).

## Installation
To run the application locally, follow these steps (bash):

1. Install streamlit:
	```pip3 install streamlit```

2. Create a virtual environment:
	```python3 -m venv streamlit_env```

3. Activate the virtual environment:
	```source streamlit_env/bin/activate```

4. Install the required libraries:
	```pip3 install -r requirements.txt```

## Usage
To run the interface, use the following command:

`streamlit run interface.py`

## OBS
This project has in issue in the step 4. The parameters are predetermined, as traditional Topsis method.
